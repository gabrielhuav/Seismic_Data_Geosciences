# Reproducing the local audit

Core acquisition, auditing and evidence contracts need Python 3.10 or newer and only the standard library. Tests do not need network access or a running database.

```text
python scripts/audit_sources.py --help
python scripts/prepare_public_evidence.py restore
python scripts/audit_revisions.py
python -m scripts.validate_evidence
python -m unittest discover -s tests
python scripts/build_system.py
python -m http.server 8787 --bind 127.0.0.1 --directory system/dist
```

The revision command verifies every raw response against `data/raw/revisions/manifest.json`. It refuses a length or SHA-256 mismatch. `--fetch` is only for the first acquisition and refuses to overwrite an existing manifest. The acquired cohort was selected from the current catalog, not from a complete historical event population.

The bounded original response package is retained under `research-data/comcat/`.
`prepare_public_evidence.py verify` checks all 40 response bodies and the fixed
acquisition-manifest hash. `restore` copies only those verified files to ignored
`data/raw/revisions/` without a network request and refuses to overwrite different
evidence. This restores the exact pilot inputs, rather than refetching a changed
catalogue. No historical SQL or private working documents enter the package.

The source auditor reads the historical SSN-derived SQL only in read mode. Its source directory can be selected with the command-line option shown by `--help`; skip it when those local historical files are unavailable. Generated alternatives for UTC dates are hypotheses, not observed timestamps. No SQL statement or upstream executable is run.

The frozen CSV input is versioned in `data/source_manifest.json`; `--download` obtains missing bytes and verifies their pinned hashes. The historical SQL is not redistributed or required by the revision audit.

For a fresh checkout, rebuild the separate CSV diagnostic and website data with
`python scripts/audit_sources.py --download --skip-ssn`, then
`python scripts/build_system.py`. The optional historical SSN diagnostic requires
its separately identified upstream input and is not needed for the explorer,
revision analysis or evidence-contract evaluation. Prepare local map assets with
`python scripts/fetch_map_assets.py`; all pinned Leaflet and Natural Earth bytes
are verified before use.

## Evidence semantics

`scripts/evidence_contract.py` distinguishes captured summaries from conditional retained-lineage projections. A `selected_lineage_count` is not a count of unique physical earthquakes. A producer timestamp is not an authenticated public release time. Supplying current and superseded products does not identify complete past catalog membership or preference.

Synthetic counterexamples and tests are labeled synthetic. They test software semantics and logical possibilities; they do not estimate empirical frequency or validate a past public catalog.

`python -m scripts.validate_evidence` independently ranks retained versions with
SQLite window functions and applies SQL predicates after version selection.
It checks the original 36 details at 472 event-specific retained boundaries and
ten queries (4,720 comparisons). Eight generated histories supply 24 additional
query cases with known synthetic public replay. Reports under ignored
`outputs/validation/` record original-byte hashes separately from generated
fixtures and explicitly preserve product-lineage versus public-event units.
Zero projection disagreements do not authenticate public availability or make
the histories complete. The illustrative policies are not implementations of
libcomcat, Timeline or the INGV service.

## Figures and manuscript

`python scripts/make_figures.py` regenerates traceable PNG, PDF and SVG figures. Install matplotlib in the chosen scientific environment first. This run used the Codex bundled Python 3.12.14 and matplotlib 3.11.2 in the ignored `tmp/paper_deps` directory. Hashes, subsets and versions are recorded in `paper/figures/figures_manifest.json`.

The author-review manuscript source is local in `paper/drafts/manuscript.md`. The retained journal template and its checksum are in `paper/templates/`. `scripts/build_manuscript.py` patches a copy, preserving every unrelated package part byte-for-byte. It requires a template-distillation contract under ignored `tmp/template-contract/` and writes review artifacts to ignored `outputs/paper/`. The source, template and builder must be preserved together for regeneration. The template itself is never overwritten.

The Word/PDF render-and-review stage is separate from content generation. A generated DOCX is not visually verified until every rendered page has been inspected. This Windows environment does not bundle LibreOffice; Word-native export is used when available. No editorial submission, payment, author approval or public archival release is implied by building these files.

Manuscript drafts, generated figures and the downloaded template DOCX are local
authoring artifacts, excluded from Git. Template provenance and the authoring
scripts remain portable. Reproducing the private manuscript therefore also
requires its maintained source, the original template matching the recorded hash
and the local template-distillation contract. A code checkout does not claim to
contain unpublished manuscript material.

## Scope of interpretation

The regional rectangle is latitude 14–33 and longitude −118–−86 degrees. It includes offshore areas and neighboring countries. Different reported magnitude types are not equated. Missing uncertainty is unknown, never zero. Differences between retained solutions are not accuracy errors or demonstrated improvements. The current-selected 36-event pilot does not estimate historical threshold migration, completeness, damage or earthquake probability.
